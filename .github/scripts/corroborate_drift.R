# Tier 2 of the drift-alert system. Only runs when check_drift.R flagged
# something. For each flagged source, renders its live public page with
# chromote (same technique as the manual 2026-08-03 spot-check that found
# the Applitrack bug) and scores the visible text with
# score_page_text_for_job_signal() -- UNLESS check_drift.R already attached
# a real scrape_error (this run's own safe_scrape() logged a live HTTP
# failure for that source, not just an empty result -- see drift_check.R's
# attach_scrape_log_errors()), in which case that's a stronger, cheaper
# signal than a page-text guess and the render is skipped entirely: a
# broken/migrated tenant can still read as a normal, well-formed page when
# rendered fresh in chromote -- scoring its text would misreport it as
# "looks_genuinely_empty" or "inconclusive" instead of "this scraper is
# erroring." Writes /tmp/drift_report.md -- only created if there's
# something worth a human looking at; a report full of nothing but
# looks_genuinely_empty isn't worth alerting on.
#
# When GEMINI_API_KEY is set, it also runs the already-rendered page text
# through the LLM extractor (llm_titles_from_page_text) and folds the result
# into the verdict via combine_verdict_with_llm(): an "inconclusive" text
# score plus real LLM-read titles becomes "likely_broken" with the exact
# postings the scraper is missing listed in the issue. Ported from the
# Montana dashboard, where it replaced a by-hand diagnosis. No key -> this
# step is a no-op and the behaviour is unchanged.
