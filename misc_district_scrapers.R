# Scrapers for the "miscellaneous" K-12 districts that don't sit on any of
# the major platforms covered by direct_api_scrapers.R (previously hand-
# maintained in otherjobs.xlsx, which no code in this repo ever wrote).
#
# Two complementary sources, deliberately kept separate rather than forced
# into one:
#
# 1. WSBA (Wyoming School Boards Association) publishes a statewide
#    vacancies page (wsba-wy.org/vacancies) with clean, reliably-parseable
#    structured entries (title/district/location/posted-date). It's
#    actively current, but a direct comparison against several districts'
#    own sites (Niobrara County SD1, Weston County SD1) found it
#    systematically omits classified/support/substitute/assistant-coach
#    postings -- only ~25-40% of a district's real open positions
#    typically appear there. It is NOT a complete source on its own.
#
# 2. Each district's own site, to catch what WSBA misses. These sit on six
#    different small-business/school-CMS platforms (Apptegy, Edlio,
#    SchoolBlocks, SmartSites/ParentSquare, WordPress, Google Sites), none
#    of which model job postings as structured data -- postings are free-
#    text prose, bulleted lists, embedded-JSON file listings, or (Platte
#    County SD1 specifically) image alt-text with no visible title text at
#    all. Extraction here is necessarily heuristic per platform family,
#    tested against real captured content, but inherently less reliable
#    than every other source in this pipeline. All but Apptegy turned out
#    to be server-rendered (confirmed by comparing plain httr2 output
#    against a chromote-rendered page) -- only Apptegy's 4 districts
#    (Niobrara 1, Platte 2, Sheridan 3, Weston 7) genuinely need a browser.
#
# Entries found on a district's own page are deduplicated against that
# same district's WSBA entries by normalized title (lowercased, whitespace/
# punctuation collapsed) before being combined -- see
# dedupe_against_wsba(). This is a heuristic match, not exact: differently-
# worded titles for the same real posting (e.g. WSBA's "K-12 Music/Band
# Instructor" vs. a district's own "Job Description - Music Teacher K12")
# will not be recognized as duplicates and may appear twice. Prefer a
# missed duplicate over a silently dropped real posting.

# Previously assumed server-rendered, "same underlying rendering as the WSBA

# real live page contains none of its actual posting text at all (checked
# for "accepting applications", not present), while a chromote render of the
# identical URL shows it in full. This had been silently returning 0 rows
# for real, live postings the whole time it was plain-HTTP -- not a
# genuinely quiet district. Two independent title patterns confirmed on the
# real rendered page, both numbered ("N-"), but in opposite title/district
# order:
#
# 1. "N-  TITLE District Name County School District #N is
#    looking/seeking/accepting..." -- title comes BEFORE the district name
#    (e.g. "1-   High School Boys Assistant Swim Coach Uinta County School
#    District #6 is taking applications..."). Whitespace after the "N-" is
#    NOT reliably zero, unlike this pattern's original single confirmed
#    example ("1-Musical Director...") -- the real page uses anywhere from
#    0 to 3 spaces, so this must tolerate `\s*`, not assume none.
# 2. "N- District Name County School District #N is accepting/taking
#    applications for [a/an] TITLE." -- the inverse order, title comes
#    AFTER the district name and a fixed "applications for" phrase, ending
#    at the next period (e.g. "1- Uinta County School District #6 is
#    accepting applications for a HS Musical Assistant Director."). Not
#    caught by pattern 1's lookahead at all, since here the district name
#    comes immediately after the number, not the title -- confirmed this

# no consistent internal markup between cells (even within the same
# school's own table -- confirmed directly: some titles are wrapped in a
# bold <span>, others aren't; the "NEW" tag sometimes shares the title's
# own line, sometimes gets its own; "(All Positions Filled)" appears
# inline after the title on some rows and on its own line on others).
# Requires a real browser User-Agent for the same reason TedK12 does (see
# fetch_tedk12_postings() in direct_api_scrapers.R) -- unrelated platforms,

# Apptegy (Niobrara County SD1, Platte County SD2, Sheridan County SD3,

# browser
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Apptegy content pages are a client-side-rendered Nuxt app; the raw HTML
# has no posting text at all (confirmed directly -- a plain fetch returns
# an empty shell). Postings are free prose written by each district's own
# staff, with no shared template -- three patterns confirmed across real
# districts: "Title: description..." (Niobrara 1), "ALL-CAPS TITLE-
# District Wide" with no description (also Niobrara 1), and "Title
# $NNN/day" (Platte 2). fetch_apptegy_postings() takes a chromote session
# so callers can reuse one browser across all four Apptegy districts
# instead of paying startup cost per district.
#
# KNOWN INCOMPLETE, more so than every other platform here: checked all 4
# Apptegy districts' real current pages directly (not just Niobrara 1) and
# found postings these three patterns still don't catch -- Sheridan 3 has
# bare title-only lines with no punctuation marker at all ("Bus Drivers"),
# and Weston 7 mixes several different free-prose phrasings on the same
# page, including a title embedded mid-sentence ("...is currently
# accepting applications for the Middle School Football Coach starting
# with..."). Adding a bare-short-line pattern to catch Sheridan 3's style
# would false-positive heavily on Apptegy's own generic nav/footer text
# ("MENU", "SIGN IN", "Find Us", "Stay Connected", all short Title-Case-or-
# caps lines); not attempted for that reason. Apptegy districts are
# comparatively low-value to get perfect anyway since WSBA already covers
# some of what they post -- treat this specifically as best-effort partial
# coverage, not a completeness guarantee the way the other 5 platforms are.

  #    which happens to be long enough to pass a bare length check -- real

  #    description at all and would be silently missed by the colon

  # 4. A lead-in sentence ending in a colon ("...is currently accepting
  #    applications for the following [N] position[s] for the ... school
  #    year:") followed by a flat list of bare title lines, one per real
  #    posting -- confirmed on Weston 7's real page (5 substitute titles
  #    with no per-title punctuation marker at all -- not caught by any of
  #    the 3 patterns above -- plus a second, single-posting instance of
  #    the same lead-in shape further down the same page). Works on the

  #    sentence itself across multiple lines/blank-line paragraph breaks
  #    (confirmed: "...for the 26/27" and "school year:" land on two
  #    separate paragraphs). Scoped tightly to avoid the false-positive
  #    risk the header comment above already flagged for a bare
  #    short-line pattern: requires the specific "accepting applications
  #    for the following" phrase (not just any colon), and stops
  #    consuming candidate titles at the first paragraph that's either
  #    long (a real prose sentence, e.g. the district's own follow-up
  #    boilerplate about how to apply) or itself contains an embedded
  #    line break, rather than a fixed count -- so it degrades to
