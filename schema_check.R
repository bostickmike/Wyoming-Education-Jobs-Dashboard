# Schema-drift guard for every dataset app.R reads by name.
#
# Every existing check in this repo (sanity_check.R, drift_check.R,
# check_salary_drift.R's coverage/plausibility checks) validates the DATA:
# how many rows, whether the numbers look sane. None of them check that the
# COLUMNS a downstream pipeline chunk or app.R itself references by name
# actually exist -- a chunk silently dropping or renaming a column (a
# refactor typo, a classifier change that forgot to update a select()) would
# still pass every one of those checks (they don't look at column names at
# all) and then crash app.R with a cryptic "object 'Teachers_Total_FTE' not
# found" for the first user who opens the dashboard after the bad deploy,
# with nothing in the error identifying which upstream FILE is actually
# responsible.
#
# check_file_schema() is the pure, testable half. .github/scripts/
# verify_schema.R is the blocking runner (like sanity_check.R, not
# diagnostic-only like drift_check.R) -- a missing column WILL break the
# live app for every user, so this has to stop the commit, not just alert
# about it after the fact.
#
# REQUIRED_SCHEMAS reflects the columns app.R actually reads by name from
# each file (verified against app.R directly, not just "whatever columns
# happen to be in the file today") -- k12_salary_history.csv is
# deliberately absent since nothing in app.R reads it yet.
