# Wyoming Higher Ed faculty salary data from IPEDS (the federal Integrated
# Postsecondary Education Data System), via the Urban Institute's Education
# Data Portal -- a real public JSON REST API wrapping IPEDS's own Human
# Resources/Salaries (SAL) survey component, so no PDF/HTML scraping is
# needed here (unlike the WSBA K-12 salary data in salary_scrapers.R).
# https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/
#
# Endpoint used: college-university/ipeds/salaries-instructional-staff/{year}
# filtered to fips=56 (Wyoming). Per NCES, HR/SAL data is reported "as of
# November 1" of the same calendar year as the survey year -- e.g. year 2024
# means salaries as of Nov 1, 2024, not the "2023-24" academic year.
#
# Each institution reports one row per (academic_rank x contract_length x
# sex) combination; academic_rank/contract_length/sex == 99 means "all
# ranks/lengths/sexes combined" -- that combined row is what's extracted as
# the headline "Faculty_Avg_Salary" figure, plus the academic_rank == 1
# ("Professor") row as a second reference point, mirroring how the WSBA
# scraper surfaces both a base teacher salary and a superintendent salary.
# Negative values (-1, -2, -3) are IPEDS/Urban sentinel codes for
# not-available/not-applicable/suppressed, not real data, and are treated
# as NA.
#
# Wyoming has 9 public HE institutions in this project's salarymap.csv, but
# only 8 distinct IPEDS unitids report salary data for them -- Sheridan
# College and Gillette College are both part of the same accredited entity,
# Northern Wyoming Community College District, so IPEDS has no way to tell
# their faculty salaries apart. Both get the same figures here, flagged via
# Salary_Note rather than silently presented as institution-specific.

# IPEDS_UNITID_MAP's hardcoded shared unitid above, and app.R's suppression
# of Vacancy_Rate for both (see combined_map_data's Salary_Note check),
# will eventually go stale once IPEDS starts reporting them separately.
# When that happens, a NEW unitid will show up in the WY institution
# directory with an inst_name containing "Gillette" or "Sheridan" that
# ISN'T 240666 -- this checks for exactly that, so the split is a one-line
# assertion someone can act on instead of something to remember to
