# Wyoming school-district-level child poverty rate from the US Census
# Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) program, via the
# Census Data API's SAIPE School District time series.
# https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/data/datasets.html
#
# Requires the same free CENSUS_API_KEY census_acs_scraper.R uses (see that
# file's header for why every Census Data API endpoint needs one) -- read
# from the same environment variable, not a separate one, since it's the
# same Census API account either way.
#
# Unlike census_acs_scraper.R's county-level join, this is real DISTRICT-
# level data (SAIPE's own SD_NAME field, not a county name) -- the closest
# free proxy to free/reduced-lunch eligibility at the actual district a
# posting is in, not just its county. No separate NCES LEAID crosswalk was
# needed: SAIPE's own SD_NAME field already matches this project's
# canonical district naming almost exactly (confirmed live 2026-08-06, 47
# of 48 real WY districts matched directly on name alone) -- the one
# exception is the same Big Horn/Natrona "<County> County School District"
# vs. "<County> School District" quirk canonicalize_ccd_district_name()
# (ccd_staff_scraper.R) and canonicalize_wsba_district_name()
# (salary_scrapers.R) already handle for their own sources, handled the
# same way here rather than shared, matching how those two don't share one
# either -- each source's own name format is close-but-not-identical in
# its own way.
#
# "school district (unified)" (GEOCAT 970) is the right geography type for
# Wyoming -- WY districts are K-12 unified districts, not the separate
# elementary/secondary districts SAIPE also tracks in some other states.
# Fremont County School District 38 (Arapahoe Charter High School) is the
# one confirmed real WY district absent from SAIPE's output entirely
# (checked live 2026-08-06) -- left as a real NA after the join rather than
# something to force-match, the same kind of genuine coverage gap every
# other external source in this project already has somewhere.
