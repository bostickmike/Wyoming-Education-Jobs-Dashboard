# Repairs historical K-12 title mojibake caused by fix_title_encoding()'s
# original bug: it unconditionally treated every scraped title as
# Windows-1252, so genuine UTF-8 punctuation (curly quotes, en/em dashes,
# ellipsis) that had already been correctly decoded got double-encoded
# into garbage -- "Teacher's Aide" became "Teacherâ€™s Aide". Fixed for
# all FUTURE scrapes (fix_title_encoding() now only repairs strings that
# actually fail a UTF-8 round-trip), but that fix can't retroactively
# detect titles already corrupted and archived, since the corruption is
# technically valid UTF-8 now -- just semantically wrong. This is
# deliberately a narrow migration: it only reverses double-encoding it can
# PROVE explains the observed bytes (see repair_mojibake()'s own header),
# and separately repairs any genuinely-invalid UTF-8 byte still sitting
# raw in an old snapshot (from before fix_title_encoding() existed in the
# pipeline at all) the same way the live pipeline already does.
#
# Run from the repository root:
#   Rscript scripts/repair_k12_title_mojibake.R --dry-run
#   Rscript scripts/repair_k12_title_mojibake.R --apply
#
# --apply rewrites the affected Archivek12_Data/*.csv snapshots and the
# current Wy_Ed_Jobs/combinedclean.csv, then rebuilds k12jobanalysis.csv/
# allsum.csv/k12_district_weekly_totals.csv/allnow.csv from the repaired
# archive. Git retains the before-state for review/reversion; inspect git
# diff before committing.
#
# HE titles were checked and confirmed NOT affected -- Wy_ED_Jobs.Rmd never
# applies fix_title_encoding() to Higher Ed Title at all, so hedata.xlsx/
# Archived_HE_Data/ were never exposed to this bug in the first place.

# Reverses CP1252-as-UTF8 mojibake: text that was genuine UTF-8, got wrongly
# decoded as WINDOWS-1252 (one Unicode char per original byte), then
# re-encoded as UTF-8. Reversal: re-encode the corrupted string AS
# WINDOWS-1252 to recover the original raw bytes, then decode those bytes
# as UTF-8.
#
# Only accepted when re-simulating the SAME corruption mechanism on the
# reversed text exactly reproduces the observed corrupted string
# byte-for-byte. That exactness check -- not a guessed signature pattern --
# is the real safety net: it's what proves a given reversal is the one true
# explanation for the observed bytes, not a coincidence, and it's why
# genuinely-correct accented text (e.g. a real "e"-acute in a name) that
# happens to contain a non-ASCII byte is left untouched -- reversing
# never-corrupted text either fails to decode as valid UTF-8 at all, or
# round-trips to something that doesn't match the original, and both cases
# are rejected.
#
# Candidates are prescreened to strings containing any non-ASCII byte
# (cheap, and correct without needing to enumerate WINDOWS-1252's own
# printable remappings of the 0x80-0x9F byte range, which differ from
# Latin-1/ISO-8859-1 in that range and would be easy to get subtly wrong by
# hand) -- pure-ASCII strings can never be mojibake of this kind and skip
# the iconv round-trip entirely.
