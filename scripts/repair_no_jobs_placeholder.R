# Repairs the historical "No jobs" placeholder fabrication: the pre-registry
# Applitrack loop in Wy_ED_Jobs.Rmd inserted a literal title = "No jobs" row
# whenever a district's scrape returned zero real postings, so a genuinely
# empty week would still produce a row -- unlike every other platform in the
# same pipeline (TedK12/SchoolSpring/RedRoverK12), which simply drop an empty
# result and let safe_scrape()'s own "empty" log entry be the record of it.
# That placeholder was never real scraped data; it was pipeline code
# fabricating a row. Fixed at the source in the registry-driven loop (see
# git history for "Fix the 'No jobs' Applitrack placeholder" and the
# k12_district_registry.csv migration immediately before it) -- this script
# repairs the damage the old behavior already did to committed data before
# that fix: confirmed present in Archivek12_Data snapshots back to
# 2025-10-03 (Fremont County SD24, Lincoln County SD1, Sublette County SD9,
# and Fremont County SD24's own earlier-dated duplicate), and it wasn't just
# cosmetic -- k12_district_weekly_totals.csv counts these rows the same as a
# real posting (position == "Teacher"-filtered k12jobanalysis.csv is
# unaffected, since classify_k12_position("No jobs") is "Other", not
# "Teacher"), so it currently reports these three districts as having a
# steady 1 open position for months where the true count was 0.
#
# Run from the repository root:
#   Rscript scripts/repair_no_jobs_placeholder.R --dry-run
#   Rscript scripts/repair_no_jobs_placeholder.R --apply
#
# --apply removes the fabricated rows from the affected raw archive
# snapshots and the current combinedclean.csv, then rebuilds
# k12jobanalysis.csv, allsum.csv, and k12_district_weekly_totals.csv from
# the now-clean archive via rebuild_k12_history_from_archive() (the same
# disaster-recovery rebuild tests/testthat/test-history-accumulator.R checks
# for equivalence against the incremental accumulator). Git retains the
# before-state for review/reversion; inspect git diff before committing.
