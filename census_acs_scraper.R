# Wyoming county-level socioeconomic context from the US Census Bureau's
# American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates, via the Census Data API
# directly (not the Urban Institute Education Data Portal this project uses
# elsewhere for CCD/IPEDS -- Census's own API doesn't wrap this data).
# https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html
#
# Requires a free Census API key (https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)
# -- every endpoint here 302-redirects to an error page without one, even
# for a single low-volume request (confirmed 2026-08-06). Read from the
# CENSUS_API_KEY environment variable -- a GitHub Actions secret for the
# weekly pipeline, .Renviron locally -- never hardcoded or committed.
#
# One row per Wyoming county (23 total), joined onto salarymap2.csv's
# existing County column (already formatted "<Name> County, Wyoming",
# matching the API's own NAME field exactly -- no separate FIPS lookup
# needed for the join, though FIPS is kept in the output for reference).
#
# Four figures, all from the ACS 5-Year Estimates (the only ACS product
# reliable enough at Wyoming's small-county population sizes -- 1-year
# estimates have margins of error too wide to be meaningful for most WY
# counties):
#   - Median household income (B19013_001E)
#   - Median gross rent (B25064_001E)
#   - Mining/oil & gas share of civilian employment (S2403_C01_004E /
#     S2403_C01_001E, the ACS Subject Tables endpoint) -- Wyoming's
#     energy-producing counties (Campbell, Sublette, Sweetwater, Converse)
#     pay teachers measurably more specifically to compete with these
#     wages for the same local labor pool; this is the one figure here
#     that helps explain WHY salaries vary across WY districts, not just
#     what the cost of living looks like. Confirmed live 2026-08-06:
#     Sublette (12.6%) and Campbell (17.6%) vs. Teton (0.3%) -- a huge,
#     real spread, not noise.
#   - Population change vs. 5 years earlier (B01003_001E, current vintage
#     vs. one 5 years back) -- growing vs. shrinking community, a longer-
#     term signal current job openings alone can't show. Built from two
#     ACS 5-Year vintages rather than the Population Estimates Program
#     (PEP): PEP's API restructured at some point after the 2020 Census,
#     and the modern endpoint/variable names couldn't be found working
#     during a live check (2026-08-06) across several attempted
#     year/variable combinations (pep/population/variables.json itself
#     404s), while ACS5's population total is stable, already the same
#     API family as everything else here, and accurate enough for a
#     multi-year trend at this scale.
